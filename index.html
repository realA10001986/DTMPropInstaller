<H1>Welcome to the CS/A10001986 DTM Prop Installer</h1>

<p>This page is intended to ease firmware installation on fresh NodeMCU ESP32 boards for use in CircuitSetup/A10001986-designed DTM props such as <a href="https://tcd.out-a-ti.me">Time Circuits Display</a>, <a href="https://fc.out-a-ti.me">Flux Capacitor</a>, <a href="https://sid.out-a-ti.me">SID</a>, <a href="https://dg.out-a-ti.me">Dash Gauges</a> or <a href="https://vsr.out-a-ti.me">VSR</a>.</p>

<p>Using this page, you can install a generic A10001986 Installer on your ESP32. Once installed, connect your computer or hand-held to a WiFi network named "NP-AP". Then navigate your browser to http://install.local or http://192.168.4.1 and click on "Update". On the page presented then, select a firmware binary for either TCD, FC, SID, Dash Gauges or VSR to install, and click "INSTALL" to proceed. The firmware will be installed on your ESP32 and it is ready for use in your prop. Future firmware updates can be done through the prop's firmware, a re-installation of the generic Installer - as presented on this page - is not required.'</p>

<p>In order to proceed, connect your NodeMCU ESP32 board to your computer, wait a few seconds, and click "Connect".</p>
